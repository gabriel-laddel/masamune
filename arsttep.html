<b>Note to the reader:</b> This draft describes the program <a href="https://github.com/gabriel-laddel/masamune">Masamune</a> as if it were ready to release (i.e. more complete than it is). Coupled with the sources it provides sufficient information for another to complete the implementation.

<p>
~MOOCS (massively open online courses and the like) have embraced popular braindamage and doomed themselves. Technically this resolves to Ivy League students pouring their lives into a website. Strategically: integration with the fiat rather than bitcoin. New frontiers have opened, Masamune provides foundations for mission critical programmes of the future. A technically sophisticated education system is trivially implemented on correct foundations.

<p>
In spite of the (pseudo-)intellectual and fiscal attention over the past several years, the education system remains broken. The intuition that computers can automate its more boring processes is certainly correct, but thus far programmes so rooted have succeed only in embarrassing their stakeholders. The traditional educational system has functioned for centuries, spanning war, famine, disease and all other disasters. Ample information exists to have formalized its purpose, an understanding of the decay, problem statement and solution. As of yet, <code>nil</code>. The only variation of note in the ~MOOCs is the scheme employed to teach computer science. The bifurcation is an evolutionary dead end, but in the interests of completeness,
</p>

<p>
<b>Branch 0</b> 
</p>

<p>
Coursera, EdX and their derivatives instruct using a combination of videos and supplementary materials (~wiki pages). Students watch videos, translate contents into their local computing environments and submit programs to the MOOC via command line. In principle, one can teach anything in this fashion, but no data can be gathered about the learning process. ML is not magic. The combination of a single website's clickstream data and the output of submitted programs is pedagogically uninteresting.
</p>

<p>
<b>Branch 1</b> 
</p>

<p>
Udacity, Khan, Code Academy and their derivatives have created proprietary online editors with each engineering team supporting a different subset of programming languages and their associated toolchains. This choice, regardless of said engineer's inevitable protests about what is "natural", "intuitive" and "friendly" reduces to the language(s) they're most familiar with. Supporting a language on this architecture requires forever mirroring its tooling and idioms in their custom environment at ~the cost of the original. This doesn't scale. Furthermore, web browsers are a technological dead-end. They lack and will forever lack access to the OS level resources required when writing of programs of non-trivial academic or commercial interest. The student who programs in his free time will quickly discover that what he's being taught isn't the actual practice of programming and that reading documentation is a far more effective strategy.
</p>

<p>
No ~MOOC has made even a perfunctory attempt at untangling the gordian knot of publishing/grant-writing/salami-science. All have opted to host, vet and assist in the production of all content available on their websites. Adoption of this system would result in a single bureaucracy which hosts and controls the entirety of scientific discourse; a serious regression from the present arrangement.

<h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Purpose of the University System</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<blockquote>
<p>
[University training] is the education which gives a man a clear conscious view of his own opinions and judgments, a truth in developing them, an eloquence in expressing them, and a force in urging them. It teaches him to see things as they are, to go right to the point, to disentangle a skein of thought, to detect what is sophistical, and to discard what is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
&#x2013; Cardinal John Henry Newman, The Idea of a University, 1852.

<p>
The primary responsibility of the university system is the education of its students. Economic prosperity, technological progress etc. are emergent properties of an education system with the correct priorities.

We know how to build a functional education system: admittance based on intellectual merit alone. That the no silicon valley startup or discussion in the public sphere originates from these coordinates is positive proof that the thinking portion of humanity faces far more serious issues than a broken education system. Do you find yourself marveling at the pinnacles of human achievement that are Apple, Facebook, Twitter and Groupon? Do you find the extant governments capable and conscious? Are you a pig rooting for scraps amongst perls? No? Perhaps then, you favor the sane interpretation of reality: Technological stagnation and systemic incompetence propped up by increasingly irrelevant governments, academic institutions and a largely impotent populace.
</p>

<p>
The personal computer dated bureaucracy. Nevertheless, graduate students the world over waste their time laboring over the most expressive machine ever created to fit their work to the procrustean bed of the pdf for the convenience of decrepit pencil pushers. The individual who chooses to step outside the system finds himself confronted with an ever-expanding set of inane regulation, an enormous variety of technological choices and immediate threat of financial problems (i.e., which combinations of toys will result in stormtroopers kicking in the door, followed by a lengthy court battle?).  If the populace wished to end this insanity: write a program that makes interacting with existing political processes a chore rather than a career. Users (legal residents with a desktop computer) must be able to post issues, solutions, conduct <i>uncensored</i> discussions, monitor budgets and draft legislation. Meatspace committees and the like are recognized as an obsolete formality via cleanly defined interfaces (e.g., within some political grouping, a proxy is hired to appear at the appropriate meetings and sign the papers), ensuring decisions made <i>at the user's convenience</i> are translated into practice. Amazon-review style semi-automated grouping of ~identical comments and a fundamentally extensible architecture would suffice to fend off <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=zerg%20rush">the zerg</a>. If the will of the community were to be subverted, document the incident and respond accordingly. The actual workings of the system, rather than a politically-correct fantasy, are to be documented. It should be trivial to trace responsibility. If the political process is so broken that orderly resolution of disputes is impossible, move. The map is not the territory. Adjust as needed.
</p>

<p>
I'm unaware of any serious proposals or implementations of a program approximating the above.<sup><a id="fnr.1" name="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> While it is conceivable such systems serve private interests, humanity's lack of technological sophistication indicates that they do not, or are controlled by the pathologically boring. Occam's razor says: the aged <a href="http://search.bitcoin-assets.com/?q=lizard+hitler">lizard club</a> that calls shots do not fully understand the possibilities offered by the computer and fear those who do. Those who do, in turn, don't care to preserve the establishment. Given this, I see no realistic path for a continuity of the established order to one that is technologically sophisticated. The reification of that reality would require that a formidable collection of intelligent, technically literate and politically astute individuals (i.e., actual leaders of men) choose to sacrifice their youth for the existing order (with the apparat fighting them every step of the way) rather than plying their ample ability in pursuit of personal profits.
</p>

<p>
It follows that we can expect yet more draconian regulation from bureaucrats, who, upon encountering that which they do not understand, attempt to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jan/11/david-cameron-snoopers-charter-tory-election-win">regulate it out of existence</a>, birthing yet more problems and further alienating thinking persons, who create yet more intricate complexities, eventually encountered by bureaucrats&#x2026;  
</p>

<p>
USG has traveled down far enough down this path to render itself almost entirely irrelevant.<sup><a id="fnr.2" name="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup> How and when the system implodes is up for debate.<sup><a id="fnr.3" name="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup>

There are many educational organizations attempting to leverage computing. None have a clearly articulated destination. A distillation the the ideas floating about yields:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
I need the ability to publish a unit of research as an interactive program containing all information used to draw my conclusions. It shall be entirely and trivially modifiable, extensible, and if reproducing the research is possible on this machine, running the program shall be a single click or procedure call away. WYSIWYG tools shall be included and fashioned from the precepts of geometry. Thus, if the supplied graphics routines are inadequate, I can fall back on an 'api' independent of man. Lessons, as a refinement of research, shall offer the same capabilities. Networking (e.g., sharing these programs or crafting interactions between them) shall be trivial. No single authority shall dictate what is an isn't appropriate to publish. This is not to be enforced by social machinery which promises to promote and cherish scientific inquiry, but as a consequence of a comprehensible, expressive design that empowers the individual.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
There are a couple programs that, at first glance, appear to be approaching this ideal. Mathematica has graphics, scientific libraries, is trivially embeddable in the web (although the client must be running the Mathematica plug-in to see the content), etc. Unfortunately, the internals are closed and cannot be extended. It is a technological dead-end.<sup><a id="fnr.4" name="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> The browser shares the same fate. It is a confusion of <a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2010/10/every-day-i-learn-something-new-and-stupid/">design anti-patterns</a>, contradictory computing philosophies and unsophisticated corporate interests. The killing blow however, is the complexity of its implementations. E.G., Chrome is composed of 22,184,180 lines of code (LoC), spanning 26 languages. Firefox? 16,851,582 and 31+. The remainder, idem. Meaningful evolution of "the web" is impossible.<sup><a id="fnr.5" name="fnr.5" class="footref" href="#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
In the years preceding the subprime mortgage crisis, sanity was piecewise replaced with "liberté, égalité, fraternity" and the proletariat were <a href="http://www.xach.com/naggum/articles/3144868668727852@naggum.no.html">temporarily loaned a lifestyle</a> they're ill-equipped to command. <a href="http://trilema.com/2013/digging-through-archives-yields-gold/">Unsurprisingly</a>, this system imploded. The selfsame disease has finally eaten its way through the contemporary education system. Its reach is (somewhat morbidly) impressive. From the slums to the Ivy leagues, it spans the whole of American society (and then some, e.g. East Asian elites eager to merit wash<sup><a id="fnr.7" name="fnr.7" class="footref" href="#fn.7">7</a></sup> their offspring).  Easy money is introduced to the bottom under a variety of names: institutional loans, diversity scholarships, free community college, student athlete programs, financial assistance, <a href="http://trilema.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/tlp.html">ssi, medicare, medicaid</a>, project head start, welfare, etc. Those on the dole, irrespective of if they're living in the hood or the <a href="http://log.bitcoin-assets.com/?date=29-01-2015#996753">kommunalki</a> spend it on televisions, smartphones, shiny new macbooks and the like. Students from the tech industry's feeder schools, fatigued from the <a href="http://thelastpsychiatrist.com/2014/04/the_maintenance_of_certificati.html">meaningless competitions</a> that define the world's most excellent sheep, are more than happy to cater to the boorish tastes underwritten by taxpayers and a ballooning national debt. <a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=918">Castrating the general purpose computer</a> and <a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=1277">marketing</a> it as the <i>new</i> user-friendly<sup><a id="fnr.8" name="fnr.8" class="footref" href="#fn.8">8</a></sup> nothing in particular is far less intellectually demanding than solving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_architecture#Von_Neumann_bottleneck">actual problems</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://trilema.com/2014/the-mobile-revolution-or-what-consumers-have-come-to-expect/">Computing for the masses</a> is as much of a disaster as the moniker suggests. OpenGL, "the industry standard for high performance graphics" is prototypical <a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=55">computational bedrock</a>. It is so broken, complex and simply wrong at every level of abstraction that it pollutes any system built on it. No alternatives exist<sup><a id="fnr.6.100" name="fnr.6.100" class="footref" href="#fn.6">6</a></sup> and researchers, the defense, medical industries, etc. waste a great deal of time battling it. Some would posit "it can't possibly be all that bad, 3D movies, ipads and intricately detailed video games exist". They are ill-informed. Consider:
</p>

<p>
<b>1.</b> The documentation for OpenGL is either poorly written, non-existent or so outdated that it actually manages to destroy understanding. The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/OpenGL-Programming-Guide-Official-Learning/dp/0321552628">red book</a> claims to contain the information necessary to write "modern OpenGL". <a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/R3ULSDAHYDNYM6/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=0321773039&nodeID=283155&store=books">This is a lie</a>. There is no excuse for such pathetic documentation. Few programs require more than (procedure) docstrings and perhaps a single document containing the vocabulary necessary to discuss the conceptual territory. If the program warrants a more detailed description <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/">CLHS</a> and the <a href="http://www.adaic.org/resources/add_content/standards/95lrm/ARM_HTML/RM-TTL.html">Ada Reference Manual</a> furnish sufficient inspiration.
</p>

<p>
<b>2.</b> OpenGL exists for the sole purpose of leveraging specialized hardware. In spite of this, there are endless issues at the this level of abstraction. Simple tasks, such as informing the programmer as to which features are available on a running system are missing, vendors regularly ignore bug reports, disregard the specification<sup><a id="fnr.9" name="fnr.9" class="footref" href="#fn.9">9</a></sup> and hardware doesn't necessarily function as advertised.<sup><a id="fnr.10" name="fnr.10" class="footref" href="#fn.10">10</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
<b>3.</b> GLSL (GL shading language). It has some of the syntax of C but not the semantics. The language specification is a joke and as designed, there are serious performance issues.<sup><a id="fnr.11" name="fnr.11" class="footref" href="#fn.11">11</a></sup> There is no reason for it to exist.
</p>

<p>
<b>4.</b> The surrounding ecosystem is intellectually bankrupt. Open Glut, SDL and X may not be part of OpenGL, but they're necessary for using it. All are broken by design.<sup><a id="fnr.12" name="fnr.12" class="footref" href="#fn.12">12</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
OpenGL has been in existence for 22 years and as of yet, no one has proffered a realistic plan to solve its problems.<sup><a id="fnr.13" name="fnr.13" class="footref" href="#fn.13">13</a></sup> The remainder of computing is similarly disordered.<sup><a id="fnr.14" name="fnr.14" class="footref" href="#fn.14">14</a></sup> The result is that individuals who would have to hacked together the ideal stated above in a month or so, contemplate it, play with a few ideas and then do something else when they detect that there is no reasonable foundation on which to build. When fundamental abstractions (e.g. geometry, which has suffered an artificial 2D/3D split courtesy of OpenGL) are placed outside the reach of an individual, society has no choice but to revert to the <a href="http://log.bitcoin-assets.com//?date=03-12-2014#944158">river of meat</a> approach to development. 
</p>

<p>
There is no education problem. The problems with the traditional systems of education are political. The lack of alternatives is a result of the confusion that is the extant computing stack. Sophistication blossoms from comprehensibility, not layers of obsolescent crud.

Solving the education problem reduces to <a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=284">sane personal computing</a>. Discard poor abstractions, ubiquitous technical problems disappear and the implementation of the education system of the future or the like follows directly from its requirements. One particularly pervasive delusion is the popular rendition of "computer security". The party line, "update software, avoid recursively self-aware programs, set strong passwords and leave computer programming to the professionals" is ineffectual,<sup><a id="fnr.15" name="fnr.15" class="footref" href="#fn.15">15</a></sup> furthers the ridiculous notion that users cannot possibly understand computer programs<sup><a id="fnr.16" name="fnr.16" class="footref" href="#fn.16">16</a></sup> and conflates identity, trust, security and ownership.

</p>

<p>
Don’t ask a computer security "professional."  Instead, ask an anatomist.  Or better yet, a trauma surgeon.  Or a prison medic.  A weapon no deadlier than a pencil, driven through soft flesh into your abdominal cavity, brings a miserable septic demise.  What keeps the pencils on your desk out of your abdomen, out of your neck, out of your eyes?  Do all of your pencils require authorization codes before they can be handled?  Are your kitchen knives protected by passwords?  Does the air in your home require a capability-bit check before one might breathe it?  Is the lock on your door indestructible?  Did you pay thousands for state-of-the-art security widgets?  And yet, $50 worth of dynamite could make short work of it all.  How, then, can you sleep at night?
</p>

<p>
Do we handle the perfectly genuine threats of bodily harm and property damage that many would certainly like to inflict on their fellow human beings by trying to make ourselves and our homes physically impregnable and entirely indestructible?  Or is this problem perhaps handled in some other way in civilized societies?
</p>

<p>
We are social beings first and computer users second, and appear to have forgotten this.

<a href="https://github.com/gabriel-laddel/masamune">Masamune</a> is the continuation of this order by other means. For the n00b, the most obvious divergence from the mainstream software paradigm is the unification of on and offline environments. This allows for the description and validation of what amounts to arbitrary tasks and thus implementations of what, for ~MOOCs, are impossibilities. An instructor can trivially specify that a student should perform $COMPUTATION against $URI (e.g., read a series of webpages), programmatically download materials, manipulate the editor, browser and desktop environment to suit their needs. The student no longer burns cycles on irrelevancies rooted in the differences between educational and industrial computing environments (industrial anything now employed for both roles), nor what content is or isn't available online or how the author feels about its pedagogical use (a Masamune user is just another visitor from a website's perspective). This scheme allows for a wealth of information to be collected (if so desired): files &amp; uris visited, scroll locations, window &amp; tab layouts, cursor movements etc. Consider taking a student from <code>nil</code> into economic relevance as a programmer. He is introduced to the editor, programming language, version control, documentation, given several (digital) worksheets, projects and tests. The self-oiling automation (again, if desired),

The instructor is notified of statistically significant ambiguities and students can, with a keystroke, view (un)common avenues of inquiry as determined by previously walked paths. E.G., a lesson has an inaccuracy whose solution is located in a forum post. Until the lesson is fixed students can skip the search &amp; skim dance and visit the post directly. The instructor is notified exactly where in the lesson the problem occurred and the location of the solution. In aggregate this eliminates the tedium of downloading, configuring and updating software, hunting down missing documentation, dependencies, dead links, fixing bugs, etc currently required for learning $SUBJECT.

Coupled with a <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=2597">fundamentally extensible architecture</a> this confers significant advantages unattainable by conventional means. For example, the regulation of disagreements to a discussion page is a poor substitute for the ability to simultaneously support radically different worldviews.

General UNIX, Masamune specific programs and hadware docs are indexed, searchable and correctly versioned. Documentation, when suitable, gives way to the previously described lesson system. Man, info, html documentation still open in their traditional programs, but are managed by the same system which unifies the experience (by being tied into the window manager).

</p>

<p>
Most programming languages need not exist. Consider the following program, 
</p>

<p>
<code>(3 + 2) * 8 / 3 * 3^6</code> 
</p>

<p>
Fully parenthesizing yields,
</p>

<p>
<code>(((3 + 2) * 8) / (3 * 3^6))</code> 
</p>

<p>
When computers execute programs, or humans mathematics, the order of operations must be taken into account. Moving functions to the front of each parenthesized expression and passing the remaining elements as arguments removes this ambiguity.
</p>

<p>
<code>(/ (* (+ 3 2) 8) (* 3 (^ 3 6)))</code>
</p>

<p>
Compilers make successive transformations to a valid program text eventually resulting in machine code. Strings have no structure and in practice are parsed into trees (known as an abstract syntax trees, or ASTs) prior to this reduction. We can render the AST of the preceding expressions as,
</p>


<div class="figure">
<p><img src="./ast.png" alt="ast.png" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
[ a simple encoding]
</p>

<p>
Note the final expression, <code>(/ (* (+ 3 2) 8) (* 3 (^ 3 6)))</code> is an ascii encoding of this AST. The lisp family of programming languages explicitly acknowledges this serialization scheme (known as fully-parenthesized prefix, reverse polish notation or s-expressions) by notating all programs thus. All software development "tooling" programs are fundamentally operations on an AST (e.g. find function, variable references, method renaming, tree shaking, code generation). Creating and modifying ASTs to produce syntactically valid program texts (meta-programming) is trivial in a language whose parsing algorithm reduces to "match the parens". This is fundamental. Languages with complex syntactical schemes e.g., C++ try and replicate this ability at enormous cost and <a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=498&cpage=1#comment-1812">the incidental complexity pollutes all associated systems</a>. For example, the Clang parser/AST manipulation library for C/C++ is &gt;100k LoC and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM">associated compiler,</a> <a href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=MTU1MzY">&gt;2.5 MM</a>. Lisp dialects, being based in s-expressions are trivially meta-programmed and as a result of the clear separation of concerns that results from this, lend themselves to comparatively simple implementations (e.g., Steel Bank Common Lisp is composed of ~396k LoC). All who have attempted to add fluid meta-programming facilities to the ALGOL family of languages (Java, C++, Scala, Python, GO, Javascript, Fortran, etc) have failed and will continue to fail due to the human inability to fully comprehend the syntatical schemes they can create.<sup><a id="fnr.19" name="fnr.19" class="footref" href="#fn.19">19</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
The ALGOL programmer, upon encountering that which he cannot abstract over in his language of choice, creates a new domain specific language, configuration file format or an entirely new programming language (pop quiz! how does an interpreted language differ from a configuration format - or for that matter, a DSL? How does an interpreter differ from a compiler?). It usually starts off as one dirty hack ("I want to take some text that looks like <i>this</i>, and make it look like <i>that</i>") and <a href="http://www.xach.com/naggum/articles/3163193555464012@naggum.no.html">having solved the problem immediately in his way</a> the programmer moves on, never asking why the hack was needed. If the project succeeds, 10s of persons will use the new language and quickly realize it has problems: performance, lack of a $FAVORITE-EDITOR mode, that it can't talk to other tools, that there isn't "tooling". So they regex tooling and much to their surprise, it generates false positives (regular expressions cannot respect a language's syntax short a full parser and printer - generally speaking, a task not achievable within regexes alone). After several failed attempts of the same, the codebase is deemed "unmanageable" and discarded. It is also possible one of the more educated programmers (i.e. one that passed a compilers course) makes the point that <i>what they really need</i> is a language parser that returns the AST, because the AST is the <i>actual program</i> (there can be several program texts in various syntaxes that reduce to the same AST, therefore&#x2026;), so as long as they manipulate that, they'll not generate false positives. Nevermind that any updates to the language's syntax will render it useless. If management accepts this charter, a <del>cancer</del> Clang takes root within the organization.
</p>

<p>
Masamune is written in Common Lisp, which is in turn based in s-expressions, which are in turn, meta-programmable, which in turn renders formats, new languages, special libraries for super special tooling libraries and the many "jobs" turning them out, entirely redundant. Notationally speaking, there isn't anything that Lisps cannot abstract over. Common Lisp in particular has the shortest <a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=202">OODA loop</a>, is incrementally compilable (programs are developed without restarting), has proper numerics support, documentation and a mature language specification. It is the only sane choice for building sophisticated software and thus, Masamune has been written in it. I've omitted much, Lisp has a rich history. See the footnotes for details.<sup><a id="fnr.19.100" name="fnr.19.100" class="footref" href="#fn.19">19</a></sup><sup>, </sup><sup><a id="fnr.20" name="fnr.20" class="footref" href="#fn.20">20</a></sup>

<p>
The X client (CLX), the window manager (Stumpwm) and graphics library (CLIM) are all written in Common Lisp and thus are trivially hackable. CLIM is "fashioned from the precepts of geometry" and contains critical abstractions such as output recording (essential for undo/redo) and a <a href="http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/6946">presentation-based UI</a> (summary: the end game of UI). It's ~100k LoC and much of the complexity comes from interfacing with X (i.e. can be cut at some point in the future). 3D must still be piped through OpenGL (via CL-OPENGL) and machinery has been included for common tasks (plotting, render molecules). When possible, graphics drivers default to reverse engineered versions.
</p>

<p>
Reverse engineered graphics drivers, documentation, clear boundries + Common Lisp set the stage for someone to meaningfully break standards and draw the graphics stack together under a unified banner. This will likely involve ditching X, OpenGL and blessing a set of hardware with reverse engineered drivers (i.e., if you wish to do mission-critical graphics work, purchase $HARDWARE).

The fundamental question in security is, as always, "what is being secured?". Masamune takes the position that bitcoin, private keys and user data are the only such artifacts. Securing bitcoin and private keys has been throughly discussed.<sup><a id="fnr.21" name="fnr.21" class="footref" href="#fn.21">21</a></sup> Extant computing systems are sufficiently complex that the only scheme I'm comfortable signing to is airgapping. Data collection can be toggled by setting <code>mm::*recording*</code> to <code>t</code>, <code>nil</code> as is appropriate for the operator's situation. With the ability to e.g., programmatically download a week's worth of lesson material, disconnect from the internet, <code>(setf mm::*recording* t)</code> and move sensitive information to external hard drives before connecting to the internet again, data security is effectively turned over to the user. Unlike capability systems and other such considerations, this works today. Researchers have spent years working on "secure" computing systems and <a href="http://qntra.net/2015/01/blackphone-less-opaque-than-promised/">nothing functional is available at any price</a>. Security today comes at the price of convenience, and in spite of endless derping to the contrary, airgapping is far more convenient than $MAXINT + waiting on R&amp;D.

Furthermore, the fabric of the academic world is such that it can absorb the most revolutionary ideas.

Correct foundations are not enough. Direction must be attractive enough to follow. A computer formatted with Masamune starts, introduces the operator to the minimum necessary for exploration and drops them into the lesson system to pursue their own path of inquiry. GPG provides the ability to unambiguously establish identify irrespective of geography. One can run lessons, research from a trusted identity without interfacing with third parties. Forcing social policy on such a system must be done at gunpoint. This regulates the teacher-student relationship to where it belongs - as it arises from asymmetric information distribution and acute desire. The freedom to trivially disagree - one can easily replace <i>all</i> defaults - [sets the stage for productive competition ]is the only way to ensure useful competition.

How does one profit from an entirely open, trivially modifiable system? By aiding and abetting civilization. The general strategy is to become irreplaceable for foundational organizations (select schools, governments, defense companies, computer hardware, oil refineries and <a href="http://www.xach.com/naggum/articles/3233532779857997@naggum.net.html">the like</a>) while pursuing relationships with individuals at the edge of human understanding.

Along the way money will be made on custom extensions to Masamune, contracts with select organizations and related scientific products.

Illegal immigration. Securing a border is simple: air drop pamphlets indicating that anyone attempting to cross the border will be shot. When some attempt anyways, shoot both kneecaps. I've not calculated the amount of equipment and personnel needed, but someone somewhere in the millitary has calculated the expanse of open desert a single sniper can defend, how much sleep deprivation can be withstood, its effects on accuracy, etc. My point is not this particular scheme should be enacted, but rather that solving the problem wouldn't take more than a few weeks were someone competent were in charge. Instead, par the course for being morons, the administration has declined to communicate to anyone how it plans to deal with this issue. Janice K. Brewer, the (former) governor of AZ recently (2014) sent a letter to Obama regarding federal buses dropping illegal immigrants into the state unannounced (<a href="http://townhall.com/tipsheet/katiepavlich/2014/06/04/jan-brewer-on-border-crisis-n1847660">wait, what?</a>).

This unwarranted operation is another disturbing example of a deliberate failure to enforce border security policies and repair a broken immigration system &#x2026; So that the citizens of our country may fully understand the scope and goal of this operation, I ask that your administration provide answers to me regarding the following questions: 
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Who authorized this policy, and why has the federal government selected Arizona as the target?
</li>

<li>When was the policy initiated, and how much longer is the operation expected to proceed?

<li>How many aliens have been transported from other states to Arizona and released through this operation? 
</li>

<li>How many aliens have designated Arizona as their ultimate destination?
</li>

<li>How many aliens are designated as a "family unit", and how many have been designated as "unaccompanied juveniles?"
</li>

<li>What does the federal government know about the background and histories of the aliens being transported and released in Arizona? 
</li>

<li>What proactive steps in DHS or any other federal agency undertaking to establish emergency housing/detention space to properly process those aliens?
</li>

<li>What has caused this massive influx of illegal aliens such that federal operations in Texas are unable to handle the processing of these individuals?
</li>

<li>What is being done to secure the border in Texas to prevent the continued illegal crossings that have "forced" the federal government to transport illegal aliens from Texas and release them in Arizona?

True to form, Obama has not respond, directly or otherwise. As for nuclear waste, the Obama administration, by way of the DOE has effectively terminated the Yucca Mountain facility. Jobs for all federal employees and contractors involved were eliminated via the 2011 budget, released Feb 2010. Yucca Mountain was the only WIP solution for permanent nuclear reactor waste disposal. The United States GAO (Governmental Accountability Office) report on the matter concluded there were no sane reasons for the termination.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Spent nuclear fuel is considered one of the most hazardous substances on earth. Without protective shielding, its intense radioactivity can kill a person exposed directly to it within minutes or cause cancer in those who receive smaller doses. Although some elements of spent nuclear fuel cool and decay quickly, becoming less radioactively dangerous, others remain dangerous to human health and the environment for tens of thousands of years. The nation's inventory of 65,000 metric tons of commercial spent nuclear fuel - enough to fill a football field nearly 15 feet deep

<p>
DOE's decision to terminate the Yucca Mountain repository program was made for policy reasons, not technical and safety reasons. <b>(14)</b> In a June 2010 letter to us, the Acting Principal Deputy Director of OCRWM, responding on behalf of the Secretary, stated that the Secretary's decision was based on a proposed change of department policy for managing spent nuclear fuel. He did not, however, cite any technical concerns or safety issues related to the Yucca Mountain repository. The Acting Principle Deputy Director explained that the Secretary believes there are better solutions that can achieve a broader national consensus to the nation's spent fuel and nuclear waste storage needs than Yucca Mountain, although he did not cite any. He went on to say that the Secretary has repeatedly stated his conclusions that Yucca Mountain has not proven to be a workable option for a permanent repository for high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel and that the technical and scientific context is significantly different today than it was at the time of the 1983 enactment of the NWPA.
</p>

<p>
DOE also field a reply before NRC's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, which provided additional information about the reasoning for attempting to withdraw its license application. Specifically, the reply explained that "the Secretary's judgment is not that Yucca Mountain is unsafe or that there are flaws in the license application, but rather that it is not a workable option and that alternatives will better serve the public interest."
</p>

<p>
<b>(14)</b> DOE characterized its motion to withdraw its license application as an interim step toward a final decision, not a decision that might be considered

Other officials with whom we spoke expressed concerns about DOE's ability to reassemble its team.

<b>Termination Would Restart a Costly Time-Consuming Process</b>
</p>

<p>
The termination of the Yucca Mountain essential restarts a time-consuming and costly process. In the case of Yucca Mountain, this process has already cost nearly $15 billion through 2009 and, if work on Yucca Mountain had continued, it could have cost an additional $41 billion to $67 billion more to complete, as we reported in 2009. <b>(31)</b> DOE officials told us that many factors, including some outside DOE's control, could have affected when the Yucca Mountain repository would have opened, or whether it would have opened at all. If work on licensing and constructing Yucca Mountain had continued, DOE would have had to obtain NRC license approval, certain crucial permits from the state of Nevada, funding from Congress, and other key congressional actions, such as permanently withdrawing public land from the repository. Despite these challenges, DOE's 2008 estimate for opening the Yucca Mountain repository - before DOE took steps to terminate it - was 2020. While we recognize this 2020 date was not certain, we know of no better assumption to meaningfully assess the impact of a termination of the Yucca Mountain repository program. In written comments to us, DOE officials stated it is speculation to say a new strategy will take longer to implement than continuing with the Yucca Mountain program because there was no guarantee of when, if ever, the many signifcant steps for opening the Yucca Mountain repository would have been completed. Since the comment provides only a hypothetical bounding possibility - the Yucca Mountain repository might have never opened, even without DOE's current steps to terminate it - rather than a new estimate for when the repository might have opened, we note the DOE officials' position but, with the exception of noting prior work, we do not analyze it further.
</p>

<p>
DOE officials told us that it is conceivable that an alternative to Yucca Mountain could be developed and implemented before Yucca Mountain might have ever opened, such as opening a centralized interim storage facility. Although DOE suggested that the Blue Ribbon Commission may come up with alternatives that could be implemented sooner than Yucca Mountain might have opened - particularly if the alternative has more public acceptance and avoids costly delays due to local opposition - we reported in 2009 that there were no other permanent alternatives to the Yucca Mountain repository that could be implemented sooner than the 2020 projected date of opening Yucca Mountain. Although any permanent disposal alternatives would come with uncertainties as to their cost and schedule - as well as to their public acceptance - it is likely to take decades to develop. We reported in 2009 that, according to a manager of an industry effort to establish a centralized interim storage facility, even a federal centralized interim storage facility is likely to take 17 to 33 years to plan and implement. <b>(32)</b> An interim storage facility would include, among other things, siting, licensing, and constructing the facility and accompanying transportation infrastructure, as well as coordinating transportation routes with states. If such a facility were initiated in 2011 this makes the most likely initial opening date somewhere from 2029 to 2045 <b>(33)</b> It is possible that industry might develop and implement its own interim storage facilities sooner, but, as we reported in 2009 an interim storage facility is not a permanent alternative to a repository.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, by terminating work on Yucca Mountain, DOE likely would have to restart the process for any alternative repository site, since every site is unique, according to NRC officials. Some of the officials we spoke with estimated that the termination of Yucca Mountain could set back the opening of a new geologic repository by at least 20 years and cost billions of dollars. Some stakeholders referred to the termination as "kicking the can down the road." Moreover, several DOE and NRC officials and industry representatives stated that ending the license review process before allowing NRC to review the merits of the application was a loss of potentially valuable information, particularly NRC's assessment regarding acceptability of the license application.
</p>

<p>
As a result of the termination of the Yucca Mountain repository program, DOE may also need to seek additional funding for an alternative repository. About 60 percent of the cost of developing a repository has thus far been paid for by the nuclear waste fund, but utilities only pay into the fund for as long as their reactors are operating. Most of the reactors in this country are working to obtain a license extension or have already obtained one for an additional 20 years of operation, and it is not clear how much longer reactor operators will be paying into the nuclear waste fund. As reactors retire, they will need to be replaced by new reactors paying into the fund, or, according to DOE officials, the fund will be drawn down faster than it can be replenished. According to DOE officials, the nuclear waste fund was designed to build a large surplus that could be relied upon for when very high construction costs exceed annual contributions; then, the generally high, but decades-long costs for operations, during which the nuclear waste fund is likely to be draw down. For example, our analysis of DOE's cost projections for Yucca Mountain shows that construction of a repository would have averaged over $1.7  billion annually, but with some years exceeding $2 billion. Although the costs of siting, licensing, constructing, and operating an alternate repository sites are uncertain, or even if a repository will be the path followed by DOE in the near future, DOE has already spent about $9 billion from the nuclear waste fund. If DOE were to pursue an alternate repository - assuming an alternate repository would have costs similar to the Yucca Mountain repository - it is not certain that the fund will have built up a sufficient surplus to site, license, construct and operate it. DOE makes an annual assessment of the adequacy of the nuclear waste fund to ensure that full costs of a disposal program will be fully recovered. In November 2010, the Secretary determined that the fund was adequate, even an attachment stated that DOE had no alternative to the Yucca Mountain repository, and that the Yucca Mountain repository provided the closest "proxy" - in terms of cost - to an alternative. If the nuclear waste fund does not have a sufficent surplus for an alternate repository, additional funding would have been found. One option, according to DOE officials is for the Secretary to propose an adjustment of the fee in accordance with the NWPA, but they said the agency must do so while nuclear reactors are still operating. Moreover, since the taxpayers have paid a proportion of the costs to establish a repository for DOE-managed high-level waste and spent nuclear fuel, the taxpayers may also end up paying more for an alternate repository. In addition the proposed termination has prompted calls from industry for DOE to suspend collection of payments into the Nuclear Waste Fund. Industry effort that has been shut down, with no work being done an alternative. Suspending payments into the Nuclear Waste Fund could reduce the funds set aside for a repository. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Termination Would Prolong On-site Storage and Increase Costs</b>
</p>

<p>
The proposed termination of Yucca Mountain, which has been planned to be opened in 2020, will likely prolong storage at reactor sites, which would increase on-site storage costs. Because of delays in opening the Yucca Mountain repository, on-site storage at commercial nuclear facilities has been the <i>de facto</i> near-term strategy for managing spent nuclear fuel. Most spent nuclear fuel is stored at reactor sites, immersed in pools of water designed to cool it and isolate it from the environment. With the extension of on-site storage because of the delays in opening Yucca Mountain, some reactors are running out of space in their pools and have turned to dry-cask storage systems. In 2009, we reported that such systems for reactor operators cost from about $30 million to $60 million per reactor, with costs increasing as more spent nuclear fuel is added to dry storage. <b>(34)</b> We also reported that spent nuclear fuel would likely have to be repackaged about every 100 years, although experts said this is uncertain and research is under way to better understand the longevity of dry-cask systems. This repackaging could add from about $180 million about nearly $500 million, assuming initial repackaging operations, with costs dependent on the number of casks to be repackaged and whether a site has a transfer facility, such as a storage pool.
</p>

<p>
Prolonging on-site storage would add to the taxpayer burden by increasing substantial liabilities that DOE has already incurred due to on-site storage at commercial nuclear reactors. Were DOE to open Yucca Mountain in 2020 as it had planned, and begun taking custody of spent nuclear fuel, it would still have taken decades to take custody of the entire inventory of spent nuclear fuel. Assuming a 2020 opening of Yucca Mountain, DOE estimated that the total taxpayer liabilities for the backlog as of 2020 would be about $15.4 billion and would increase by $500 million for each year of delay thereafter. <b>(35)</b> It is important to recognize that these liabilities are outside of the nearly $15 billion already spent on developing a repository and the estimated $41 to $67 billion still to be spent if the Yucca Mountain repository were to be constructed and become operational, most of the cost of which is borne by the Nuclear Waste Fund.
</p>

<p>
Instead, these liabilities are borne by taxpayers because of the government's failure to meet its commitment to take custody of the waste has resulted in lawsuits brought by industry. <b>(36)</b> Furthermore, not all of the lawsuits have been resolved and industry has claimed that the lawsuits still pending could result in liabilities of at least $50 billion. Some former DOE officials and industry and community representatives statet that the termination of Yucca Mountain program could result in an additional delay the opening of the repository by at least 20 years, which would laed to additional DOE liabilities in the billions of dollars. Until a final disposition pathway is determined, there will continue to be uncertainties regarding the federal government's total liabilities.

<b>(26)</b> This declaration was filed on April 2, 2010, as part of a federal lawsuit brought by Robert L. Ferguson, Gary Petersen, and William Lampson asking the federal court to review the final determination of the President and the Secretary of Energy to terminate Yucca Mountain.

Think of it this way: If you are writing a novel, which would
typically include dialog, you are not worrying about how to make
irony come out right on your laser printer, because there's no point
in making it visually distinct from any other text and there's no
point in involving the printer unless you have a language to talk
about the irony of a particular piece of text that could affect the
printer's behavior.  You would, however, worry about how to express
the irony in your own language.  The printer would simply render it
in whatever way it usually renders text.  When people get stuck in
the HTML world, they naturally complain about the pointlessness of
talking about irony because there's no browser that would render
&lt;irony&gt;foo&lt;/irony&gt; differently from anything else, and it would look
just like any other text.  If they <span class="underline">wanted</span> the browser to render
irony differently, they would simply write the low-level stuff that
HTML defines to cause the browsers to change the rendering, but they
would <span class="underline">still</span> not think that <span class="underline">HTML</span> supports irony.  HTML supports
the mechanisms that allows something else entirely to express irony
through its rendering-friendly language.  It is that something else
that I'm interested in.  In the case of your novel and the laser
printer, it's capturing the author's intent in a language able to
talk about its own usasge, such as English.  In the case of HTML,
it's whatever caused that particular "code" to be produced in the
first place, ultimately <span class="underline">some</span> authors' intent.
</p>

<p>
Because HTML can do certain simple tricks, and because most people
aren't aware of what they are doing, it is possible to conflate the
expression with the intention, indeed common to do so among those
who aren't and don't want to be educated.  This doesn't remove the
intent.  It only means that some people will insist that if they can
express it in HTML, there's no point in talking about the intent and
other languages that would make it easier to talk about the intent.
</p>

<p>
The fundamental deficiency in HTML is that it reduces hypertext and
the intertwinedness of human communication to a question of how it
is rendered and what happens when you click on it.  By giving the
world a language in which numerous important concepts can no longer
be expressed, these concepts are removed from our world.  When music
was written down with notes, a lot of music that was very hard to

HTML is to the browser what PostScript is to the laser printer.
Normal people don't worry about PostScript when they want to employ
irony in a dialog.  Normal people shouldn't worry about HTML when
they want to make hypertext links.  They should think of what their
<span class="underline">real</span> needs are, and trust me, those needs are <span class="underline">not</span> covered as
such by HTML, but they can still be <span class="underline">expressed</span> in HTML such that a
browser can render it to the reader, just like PostScript does not
cover the needs of an author as such, but most everything an author
wants to say can be <span class="underline">expressed</span> in PostScript and come out right.
(And that which cannot be expressed in PostScript will have a
natural tendency to become unwanted unless people change to a new
language.)
</p>

<p>
That is to say, everything I want <span class="underline">may</span> be implemented with a chain
of proxy servers that add their particular thing to the incoming
HTML, just as I could add filters that hacked PostScript to get
special effects on the laser printer.  The end result as it is given
to the browser or laser printer is <span class="underline">still</span> HTML or PostScript,
respectively, but neither the HTML nor the PostScript were created
to do what the proxy servers and filters have done <span class="underline">to</span> them.  It is
not productive to argue that "it's just HTML!  HTML can do it all!"
when the software that produces the HTML is driven by so much more
input than whatever generated the original HTML <span class="underline">or</span> the browser,
and which simply tries to teach the browser how to do things HTML
<span class="underline">can't</span> do on its own.  Which means that whether it is done by a
chain of proxy servers or a smarter browser that understands a
<span class="underline">richer</span> language than HTML is immaterial, but you still can't get a
browser that only understands HTML to do any of this stuff without
the proxy servers in between.  For instance, CSS may be employed to
change the rendering of an HTML document, and CSS may be provided by
the user to override a document's rendering.  The HTML may contain a
reference to some CSS that instructs the browser on what to do, but
that still doesn't give HTML the credit for the rendering.
</p>

<p>
To put it in yet another way: What I want the browser to do, is
accept input from a number of sources, merge them, and produce a
synthetical document that reflects decisions that none of the
sources individually can know about, because they rest with the
reader.  To achieve this without the necessary languages to describe
relationships <span class="underline">between</span> (other) documents is so cumbersome that it
is effectively removed from the wish list to begin with.  (Imagine
setting up a chain of numerous proxy services for each of the
documents you want to look at &#x2013; you can't even click on links,
anymore, because you may want to select another linking document.)
</p>

<p>
I really hope this helps.

Some may find American exceptionalism a reasonable belief; America is birthplace of the atomic bomb and digital revolution.

Various parties claim that they're going to 'fix the web'. To those innocent of the implementation details it's not clear this is impossible. in practice, unless the powers that be are willing to scrap everything that the web currently is and replace it with something sane, these projects are doomed to failure through obscurity, or by succeeding only in impressing idiots. Consider Google's PNaCl. The goal is to have a system that allows a programmer to intermix HTML, CSS and Javascript with system level resources by compiling any language down to a subset of LLVM bytecode. To produce anything on top of this tower of nonsense requires one to know the (moving) specifications for the 3 web languages + the language or languages being compiled down to LLVM bytecode. Such a system is the antithesis of comprehensibility, and thus, progress. Last I checked, You couldn't so much as get error messages through PNaCl and it's written in C++. Yes, I know they're "working on it" and oracle is still trying to work around the idiocy that is Java and africa is still trying to work around the genetic/epigenetic/cultural relationship that leads the inhabitants to <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/924795/posts">destroy anything resembling sanity</a>.

Take, for instance, "user-friendliness". Taken literally, this is like the term "motherhood": nobody can be against it, so it means nothing. And hence, if the term "user-friendliness" is given a meaning, it must be a terrible euphemism for something else. The catalogue of the average textbook publisher reveals the secret: the textbook recommendation that is deemed to be most effective is that the book is almost totally unmathematical. Mathematics, with its potential for and hence its requirement of rigour and precision, is evidently the pinnacle of user-unfriendliness. Conversely, a paper full of user-friendly topics is primarily respectable in a- or even anti-mathematical circles. (Personally I think the world could benefit from an International League for the Derision of User-Friendliness.)
</p>

<p>
There are, however, encouraging symptoms that the period in which each newly coined slogan could overnight be turned into a respectable research topic is drawing to a close, and those symptoms go beyond the button I received last year with the text "Stop BASIC before it stops you."; the fact that the Siberian Branch of the USSR Academy has launched a serious effort to prevent BASIC from being introduced at Soviet high schools is a more telling symptom.

<p>
From this country the bad news is that at one of its great Universities a specially created Vice President of Educational Computing has decided that all their undergraduates should have enough computing power at their disposal but that this required only equipment and no further education "since our kids already know how to program when they leave high school". The good news, however, is that this Vice President made himself the laughing stock of the company —with the possible exception of the company of his co-physicists—.
</p>

<p>
And also for the American Universities the tide may be turning. Traditionally they have been asked to train the work-force for the American industry, while the question of educating the industry so as to be worthy of their graduates was left untouched. But, currently, companies in Silicon Valley seem to be folding up at a higher rate than they are erected. I consider that good news because it could drive home the message that neither slogans like "knowledge-based decision aids", nor a combination of adhoccery and brute force will do the job. (It is regrettable that large groups only come to their senses after their day-dreams have turned into nightmares but, this being so, we should occasionally welcome the nightmares.) During the last decades the American Departments of Computing Science have severely suffered from a discrepancy between what society asked for and what society needed, but, be it slowly, the gap seems to be closing.
</p>

<p>
As I said earlier, the programmable computer is no more and no less than a handy device for the implementation of any thinkable mechanism. As such it poses on us the burden to demonstrate which mechanisms we can think of sufficiently clearly. It implies the challenge of blending Engineering with the techniques of Scientific Thought; this challenge is exciting and we are ready for it.

There is a simple and elegant answer to this question: Just learn Common
Lisp well first. New languages are exciting to people who know mostly
new languages, so learn an old language before you learn new ones and get
out of the maelstrom that will drown you in ever new languages that add
nothing at all except some miniscule additional feature from another
language that someone needed to make a whole new language to implement
because he did not know (Common) Lisp to begin with. A "new" language
that differs from the rest of the crop by one or a couple features is
proof positive that both what it came from and what it has become are
mutations about to die. There are tens if not hundreds of thousands of
such "languages" that people have invented over the yeare, for all sorts
of weird purposes where they just could not use whatever language they
were already using, could not extend it, and could not fathom how to
modify its tools without making a whole new language. They never stopped
to think about how horribly wasteful this is, they just went on to create
yet another language called Dodo, the Titanic, Edsel, Kyoto-agreement&#x2026;

To me, getting rich was that after 3 years I could walk away with $300,000, which was enough to buy a decent house in a nice neighborhood in LA. I left in November 1982 to do research in knowledge-based systems and programming environments at Xerox and ISI afterwards, where I still got to use lisp machines (Xerox then Symbolics). So why did I leave Symbolics after 10 months? I left because it was obvious to me that I would not get rich at Symbolics. I expected Symbolics to go belly-up after 5 years. Instead, it took 10 years simply because the software environment was so good - still better than what you can get today. How sad.
</p>

<p>
So what did I see that caused me to leave?
</p>

<p>
(1) About a month after I began working at Symbolics I went to a conference to help market Symbolics machines. The night before, I went to a large hotel room to meet the "east coast" folks. (I was one of two technical guys on the west coast.) Just after entering the room with my supervisor, he and one of the "east coast" guys started yelling at each other. The mere sight of seeing each other caused this display. And before and after this I witnessed what I considered to be excessive email flames that were distributed to all employees of the entire company. So I asked myself how can a company function (and succeed) with these kinds of problems? Good management would have had talked to these people and said something like "no matter how valuable you are to the success of this company, you are not so valuable that we can tolerate this behavior." That was never done. BAD MANAGEMENT!
</p>

<p>
(2) The company was clearly run by the researchers, who were not profit driven. This allowed all kinds of things to happen. For example, Symbolics produced a laser printer based on a Canon print engine. Why? How could we possibly compete with Canon, Xerox, and others when our printer was essentially the same as their printers? Similarly, we delivered LM-2s without the instruction pre-fetch unit, which was supposed to make the machine run 50% faster. This was because the person that was assigned to do this was busy building 16-bit digital-to-analog converters when only 8-bit digital-to-analog converters were available. (At least this is what I was told.) This was done so that Symbolics could embed high-quality sound within its keyboard. How many machines would this feature sell? If we were lucky, maybe this feature caused the sale of 3 machines. Again, BAD MANAGEMENT that was not MARKET-DRIVEN.
</p>

<p>
(3) The machine was marketed as a Lisp machine. However, it was more than that. As you mentioned it supported C, Fortran, and Ada. When I was attached to marketing I can't tell you how often I said we should be marketing to those communities too. There were a lot more C programmers than Lisp programmers. For whatever reason, all this great technology for non-Lispers was hidden. Again, BAD MARKETING. Also, what you did not mention was that Symbolics had built a VLSI design tool that they used to design the 3600 chips. Why wasn't this sold? It should have been. Again, BAD MARKETING - there was a big and growing need for tools like this (and the mney was available for expensive VLSI design stations).
</p>

<p>
(4) When I was on the front line, trying to sell Lispms, we had a major problem. I'd try to sell Lispms to friends and former associates that cost a minimum of $90K, and generally $105K out-the-door. They were typically given $120K to buy computers. This left them with a choice of purchasing 1 Symbolics machine or 3 Xerox Dolphins. They generally selected the 3 Dolphins. Our cost for the keyboard was $3,200 and our cost for the monitor screen was $8K (at least that was what I was told). My recollection was that the manufacturing cost of a Symbolics machine was over $40K. Hence, about one-third of the cost of a machine was the keyboard, mouse, and display. I told people within Symbolics to consider using a dumb display as the front-end (something like a Datapoint terminal). I can remember one employee telling me something like "if people can't appreciate why the machine is the way it is then they're stupid." Unfortunately, the potential buyers desired (drooled) to have them but few could afford them. Again, BAD MARKETING that didn't align the products that Symbolics made with those of what the market would bare.
</p>

<p>
(5) Like I said earlier, the researchers led the company, and it was obvious that a problem we'd be facing in 2-3 years was the impending explosion in Intel-based PCs. In 1980, I bought a Radio Shack TRS-80 for about $1K than ran Emacs and Lisp (written by Jonathan Allen) incredibly fast, although without a fancy GUI. Again, BAD MANAGEMENT/MARKETING.
</p>

<p>
In sum, Symbolics developed incredible technology in 1982 (and a lot more thereafter) that is still better than what is available today. It failed because marketing did not identify the products that we should be building and selling (i.e., market-driven requirements) and management did not direct its personnel to build those products. If the problems that I mentioned are obvious to me - who was a reasonably smart tech weenie that wanted to make a few bucks it should have been obvious to marketing and management folks. (It should be noted that the Symbolics sales representative for Northern California left Symbolics to become VP of Marketing for Sun Microsystems in the summer of 1982, after about a half year of employment at Symbolics. So I assume he saw the handwriting on the wall too.) I wonder what would have happened if Sun's management had been run Symbolics. I expect something much different.

CLIM &amp; Maxima were both at one point Symbolics products. Even in their inferior state on modern UNIX they are superior to anything else currently available. Knowing nothing about the underlying technology anyone in possession of a pair of eyes can verify for themselves the obvious differences between Lisp and ALGOL development,

Compare with <a href="https://youtu.be/lXVE34i-QMc?t=8m5s">ALGOL programming</a> (the video won't embed properly idkwtf). The ability to incrementally develop programs (featured in the first video) has been a cornerstone feature of Lisp since the 80s (or earlier). Doing this for production systems in other languages is a research problem because of avoidable syntactical complexities that add nothing to the language.
