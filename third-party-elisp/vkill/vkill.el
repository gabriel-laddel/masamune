;;; Commentary:

;; M-x vkill creates a buffer containing ps(1) output and allows you to
;; mvoe around in it marking processes to be sent a signal.  Type a `?'
;; in the Process Info buffer for more help.
;;
;; The commands vkill and list-unix-processes are the package entry points.
;;
;; To autoload, use
;;     (autoload 'vkill "vkill" nil t)
;;     (autoload 'list-unix-processes "vkill" nil t)
;; in your .emacs file.

;;; ChangeLog:

;; 2002-03-20  Noah Friedman  <friedman@splode.com>
;;
;; 	* vkill.el (vkill-ps-command): Convert user-uid to string for concat.
;;
;; 2001-09-09  Noah Friedman  <friedman@splode.com>
;;
;; 	* vkill.el (vkill-update-process-info): Nuke trailing whitespace
;; 	from ps output.

;;
;; 	* vkill.el (vkill-goal-column): Variable deleted.
;; 	(vkill): Don't set goal column.
;; 	(vkill-command-column-regexp): New variable.
;; 	(vkill-update-process-info): Use it to set goal column here.

;; 1993-03-29  Noah Friedman  <friedman@splode.com>
;;
;; 	* vkill.el: Set goal column to start of command.
;;
;; 1991-06-27  Noah Friedman  <friedman@splode.com>
;;
;; 	* vkill.el: Changed bsd ps arguments to get the complete command
;; 	line, added "w" command to toggle between truncated lines and line
