;;; Commentary:

;; This is an experimental magit extension for manipulating GitHub pull requests

;; In order to use this, configure your repository like:
;;   $ git config --add magit.extension gh-pulls
;;     # or whatever is required to load that extension in magit for
;;     # this repository
;;   $ git config magit.gh-pulls-repo = <user>/<repo>
;;     # your github repository

;; and of course, load magit-gh-pulls.el

;; There are currently 3 bindings for pull requests:
;; `# g g` refreshes the list of pull requests
;; `# g f` fetches the commits associated with the pull request at point
;; `# g b` helps you creating a topic branch from a review request

;; Then, you can do whatever you want with the commit objects associated with
;; the pull request (merge, cherry-pick, diff, ...)
