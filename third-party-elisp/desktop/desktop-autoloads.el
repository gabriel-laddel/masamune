Buffers with a major mode not specified here, are restored by the default
handler `desktop-restore-file-buffer'.

Handlers are called with argument list

   desktop-buffer-major-mode
   desktop-buffer-minor-modes
   desktop-buffer-point
   desktop-buffer-mark
   desktop-buffer-read-only
   desktop-buffer-locals

If a handler returns a buffer, then the saved mode settings
and variable values for that buffer are copied into it.

Modules that define a major mode that needs a special handler should contain
code like

   (defun foo-restore-desktop-buffer
