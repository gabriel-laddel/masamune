	   "asciilifeform: stalin. owned: a coat."

	   "People err who think my art comes easily to me. I assure you, dear friend, nobody has devoted so much time and thought to composition as I. There is not a famous master whose music I have not industriously studied through many times. -- Mozart"

	   "A cathedral is not a cathedral till the last scaffolding is down and out of sight. -- Gauss"

	   "Simple problems such as these soon lead to very serious difficulties. With regard to these difficulties the Greeks were divided, just as we are, into two irreconcilable factions; one stopped dead in its mathematical tracks and refused to go on to analysis -- the integral calculus, at which we shall glance when we come to it; the other attempted to overcome the difficulties and succeeded in convincing itself that it had done so. Those who stopped committed but few mistakes and were comparatively sterile of truth no less than of error; those who went on discover much of the highest interest to mathematics and rational thought in general, some of which may be open to destructive criticisms, precisely as has happened in our own generation. Form the earliest times we meet these two distinct and antagonistic types of mind: the justifiably cautious who hang back because the ground quakes under their feet, and the bolder pioneers who leap the chasm to find treasure and comparative safely on the other side. -- Men of Mathematics, pg 23"

	   "The first (without which the rest must come to nothing) is intellectual curiosity, desire to know the truth. Then, professional pride, anxiety to be satisfied with one's performance, the shame that overcomes any self-respecting craftsman when his work is unworthy of his talent. Finally, ambition, desire for reputation, and the position, even the power or the money, which it brings. It may be fine to feel, when you have done you work, that you have added to the happiness or alleviated the sufferings of others, but that will not be why you did it. So if a mathematician, or a chemist, or even a physiologist, were to tell me that the driving force in his work had been the desire to benefit humanity, then I should not have believe him (nor should I think better of him if I did). His dominant motives have been those which I have stated, and in which, surely, there is nothing of which any decent man need be ashamed.  -- G.H. Hardy, a Mathematicians apology, pg 79"

	   "However, I am digressing, as a man with a grievance always does. And after all, the main thing in determining the artistic quality of a book is not the opinions it propagates, but the fact that the writer has opinions. The old lady from Colchester was right to sun her simple soul in the energetic radiance of Bradlaugh’s genuine beliefs and disbeliefs rather than in the chill of such mere painting of light and heat as elocution and convention can achieve. My contempt for belles lettres, and for amateurs who become the heroes of the fanciers of literary virtuosity, is not founded on any illusion of mine as to the permanence of those forms of thought (call them opinions) by which I strive to communicate my bent to my fellows. To younger men they are already outmoded; for though they have no more lost their logic than an eighteenth century pastel has lost its drawing or its color, yet, like the pastel, they grow indefinably shabby, and will grow shabbier until they cease to count at all, when my books will either perish, or, if the world is still poor enough to want them, will have to stand, with Bunyan’s, by quite amorphous qualities of temper and energy. With this conviction I cannot be a belletrist. No doubt I must recognize, as even the Ancient Mariner did, that I must tell my story entertainingly if I am to hold the wedding guest spellbound in spite of the siren sounds of the loud bassoon. But “for art’s sake” alone I would not face the toil of writing a single sentence. I know that there are men who, having nothing to say and nothing to write, are nevertheless so in love with oratory and with literature that they delight in repeating as much as they can understand of what others have said or written aforetime. I know that the leisurely tricks which their want of conviction leaves them free to play with the diluted and misapprehended message supply them with a pleasant parlor game which they call style. I can pity their dotage and even sympathize with their fancy. But a true original style is never achieved for its own sake: a man may pay from a shilling to a guinea, according to his means, to see, hear, or read another man’s act of genius; but he will not pay with his whole life and soul to become a mere virtuoso in literature, exhibiting an accomplishment which will not even make money for him, like fiddle playing. Effectiveness of assertion is the Alpha and Omega of style. He who has nothing to assert has no style and can have none: he who has something to assert will go as far in power of style as its momentousness and his conviction will carry him. Disprove his assertion after it is made, yet its style remains. Darwin has no more destroyed the style of Job nor of Handel than Martin Luther destroyed the style of Giotto. All the assertions get disproved sooner or later; and so we find the world full of a magnificent débris of artistic fossils, with the matter-of-fact credibility gone clean out of them, but the form still splendid. And that is why the old masters play the deuce with our mere susceptibles. Your Royal Academician thinks he can get the style of Giotto without Giotto’s beliefs, and correct his perspective into the bargain. Your man of letters thinks he can get Bunyan’s or Shakespear’s style without Bunyan’s conviction or Shakespear’s apprehension, especially if he takes care not to split his infinitives. And so with your Doctors of Music, who, with their collections of discords duly prepared and resolved or retarded or anticipated in the manner of the great composers, think they can learn the art of Palestrina from Cherubini’s treatise. All this academic art is far worse than the trade in sham antique furniture; for the man who sells me an oaken chest which he swears was made in the XIII century, though as a matter of fact he made it himself only yesterday, at least does not pretend that there are any modern ideas in it; whereas your academic copier of fossils offers them to you as the latest outpouring of the human spirit, and, worst of all, kidnaps young people as pupils and persuades them that his limitations are rules, his observances dexterities, his timidities good taste, and his emptinesses purities. And when he declares that art should not be didactic, all the people who have nothing to teach and all the people who dont want to learn agree with him emphatically.

	   "That aside, next you wish to argue for easements - maybe children should get free food so no children starve ? Maybe young adults should get free education ? Or a minimum guaranteed wage ? Or free condoms ? Or subsidized health care ? Well... my answer will be no. They shouldn’t get anything, because if they do get easements the result will be a class of the idle poor. We don’t need, want or like a class of idle poor. Let the rich be idle, and let the poor work their hands to the bone under the whip for barely enough food to keep them going through the next day. Let there be culture and art and philosophy and literature and beautiful women and comfortable furniture and palaces and fine wines and good food and everything nice, all built on top of a huge mass of monkeys and roundworms being bled to death.

	   "The subtle difference here being that there’s no such thing as a just cause in any war, by definition. As the old saying goes, “an army is a body of men assembled to rectify the failures of diplomats”, which is exactly what’s happening : the two sides having failed to come to some sort of shared language in which to express and resolve their concerns, one of them is necessarily wrong, and must now be extirpated from history, because there’s no such thing as “mutually exclusive yet equally valid narratives of reality”. Reality is one, and somehow all incoherent retellings of any prominence will have to be resolved. And resolved they will be, either with the dutiful assistance of the heretics themselves or without the physical presence of the heretics. -- Mircea Popescu"

	   "This obviously is not the case. Rich people are rich because they’re not fucking stupid. Poor people are poor because they are fucking stupid. It’s not anything else but them themselves : they’re defective, principally in the head. They’re lesser people. That’s why others have more and they have less : because others are more and they are less. That’s it.

It may be the case someone stupid is born rich. It happens all the time. It also may be the case someone smart is born stupid. It happens all the time. Literally, every single time, all the time. Rich people don’t stay that way if they’re stupid, unless supported by some sort of socalism. People also don’t stay stupid unless oppressed by some sort of socialism (so the stupid rich may be created).

Blessfully we are at a time in history when we finally have the tool to completely dismantle and thoroughly castigate the statal edifice of stupidity. This is, incidentally, why I’m so uninclined to accept any sort of negotiation that might make Bitcoin more palatable to “the government”, as that notion is currently misunderstood. Bitcoin is here to end such misunderstanding.

	   "And this concludes my example. It has been presented because it illustrates in a nutshell the power of down-to-earth mathematics; needless to say, refusal to exploit this power of down-to-earth mathematics amounts to intellectual and technological suicide. The moral of the story is: deal with all elements of a set by ignoring them and working with the set's definition. -- Edward Dijkstra https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD04xx/EWD447.html"


	   "A scientific discipline separates a fraction of human knowledge from the rest: we have to do so, because, compared with what could be known, we have very, very small heads. It also separates a fraction of the human abilities from the rest; again, we have to do so, because the maintenance of our non-trivial abilities requires that they are exercised daily and a day —regretfully enough— has only 24 hours.

	   "Take up the White Man's burden, Send forth the best ye breed
Go bind your sons to exile, to serve your captives' need;
To wait in heavy harness, On fluttered folk and wild--
Your new-caught, sullen peoples, Half-devil and half-child.

Take up the White Man's burden, In patience to abide,
To veil the threat of terror And check the show of pride;
By open speech and simple, An hundred times made plain
To seek another's profit, And work another's gain.

Take up the White Man's burden, The savage wars of peace--
Fill full the mouth of Famine And bid the sickness cease;
And when your goal is nearest The end for others sought,
Watch sloth and heathen Folly Bring all your hopes to nought.

Take up the White Man's burden, No tawdry rule of kings,
But toil of serf and sweeper, The tale of common things.
The ports ye shall not enter, The roads ye shall not tread,
Go mark them with your living, And mark them with your dead.

Take up the White Man's burden And reap his old reward:
The blame of those ye better, The hate of those ye guard--
The cry of hosts ye humour (Ah, slowly!) toward the light:--
\"Why brought he us from bondage, Our loved Egyptian night?\"

Take up the White Man's burden, Ye dare not stoop to less--
Nor call too loud on Freedom To cloke your weariness;
By all ye cry or whisper, By all ye leave or do,
The silent, sullen peoples Shall weigh your gods and you.

Take up the White Man's burden, Have done with childish days--
The lightly proferred laurel, The easy, ungrudged praise.
Comes now, to search your manhood, through all the thankless years
Cold, edged with dear-bought wisdom, The judgment of your peers!

-- Rudyard Kipling"

	   "\"There's no sense in going further - it's the edge of cultivation,\"
So they said, and I believed it - broke my land and sowed my crop - 
Built my barns and strung my fences in the little border station 
Tucked away below the foothills where the trails run out and stop.
Till a voice, as bad as Conscience, rang interminable changes 
On one everlasting Whisper day and night repeated - so: 
\"Something hidden. Go and find it. Go and look behind the Ranges - 
Something lost behind the Ranges. Lost and waiting for you. Go!\"

So I went, worn out of patience; never told my nearest neighbours - 
Stole away with pack and ponies - left 'em drinking in the town; 
And the faith that moveth mountains didn't seem to help my labours 
As I faced the sheer main-ranges, whipping up and leading down.

March by march I puzzled through 'em, turning flanks and dodging shoulders, 
Hurried on in hope of water, headed back for lack of grass; 
Till I camped above the tree-line - drifted snow and naked boulders - 
Felt free air astir to windward - knew I'd stumbled on the Pass.

'Thought to name it for the finder: but that night the Norther found me - 
Froze and killed the plains-bred ponies; so I called the camp Despair 
(It's the Railway Gap to-day, though). Then my Whisper waked to hound me: 
\"Something lost behind the Ranges. Over yonder! Go you there!\"

Then I knew, the while I doubted - knew His Hand was certain o'er me. 
Still - it might be self-delusion - scores of better men had died - 
I could reach the township living, but... He knows what terror tore me ... 
But I didn't ... but I didn't. I went down the other side,

Till the snow ran out in flowers, and the flowers turned to aloes, 
And the aloes sprung to thickets and a brimming stream ran by; 
But the thickets dwined to thorn-scrub, and the water drained to shallows, 
And I dropped again on desert - blasterd earth, and blasting sky...

I remember lighting fires; I remember sitting by 'em; 
I remember seeing faces, hearing voices, through the smoke; 
I remember they were fancy - for I threw a stone to try 'em. 
\"Something lost behind the Ranges\" was the only word they spoke.

But at last the country altered - White Man's country past disputing - 
Rolling grass and open timber, with a hint of hills behind - 
There I found me food and water, and I lay a week recruiting. 
Got my strength and lost my nightmares. Then I entered on my find.

Thence I ran my first rough survey - chose my trees and blazed and ringed 'em -		
Week by week I pried and sampled - week by week my findings grew. 
Saul he went to look for donkeys, and by God he found a kingdom! 
But by God, who sent His Whisper, I had struck the worth of two!

Up along the hostile mountains, where the hair-poised snowslide shivers - 
Down and through the big fat marshes that the virgin ore-bed stains, 
Till I heard the mile-wide mutterings of unimagined rivers, 
And beyond the nameless timber saw illimitable plains!

'Plotted sites of future cities, traced the easy grades between 'em; 
Watched unharnessed rapids wasting fifty thousand head an hour; 
Counted leagues of water-frontage through the axe-ripe woods that screen 'em - 
Saw the plant to feed a people - up and waiting for the power!

Well, I know who'll take the credit - all the clever chaps that followed - 
Came, a dozen men together - never knew my desert-fears; 
Tracked me by the camps I'd quitted, used the water-holes I hollowed. 
They'll go back and do the talking. They'll be called the Pioneers!

They will find my sites of townships - not the cities that I set there. 
They will rediscover rivers - not my rivers heard at night. 
By my own old marks and bearings they will show me how to get there, 
By the lonely cairns I builded they will guide my feet aright.

Have I named one single river? Have I claimed one single acre? 
Have I kept one single nugget - (barring samples)? No, not I! 
Because my price was paid me ten times over by my Maker. 
But you wouldn't understand it. You go up and occupy.

Ores you'll find there; wood and cattle; water-transit sure and steady 
(That should keep the railway rates down), coal and iron at your doors. 
God took care to hide that country till He judged His people ready, 
Then He chose me for His Whisper, and I've found it, and it's yours!

Yes, your \"Never-never country\" - yes, your \"edge of cultivation\" 
And \"no sense in going further\" - till I crossed the range to see. 
God forgive me! No, I didn't. It's God's present to our nation. 
Anybody might have found it but - His Whisper came to Me!
