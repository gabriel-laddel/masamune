James Wright is the author of jwacs; he did the lexer, the Lispworks parser and
most of the source transformations, as well as all of the static analysis and
example code.

Greg Smolyn has contributed a great deal of code.  He added support for cl-yacc
and did most of the other work getting jwacs to compile under SBCL.  He also did
some extensive grammar changes to make the grammar unambiguous, and added
support for loops (by writing the loop-transformation and adding loop methods to
the cps-transformation.  He also wrote the ugly-printer and uniquification
transformation, and the initial error-reporting support in the lexer.

Red Daly took the parser code from jwacs and turned it into its own project,
to be used by other packages as they need.
