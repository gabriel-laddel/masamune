        <EditorialReview>Canon's PowerShot range of cameras has always been strong, and the PowerShot 400 continues that tradition. The 4 Megapixel Canon PowerShot S400 digital camera is capable of taking still images at 2,272 x 1,704 pixels--enough for a good quality A4 print. Resolutions go down to 640 x 480 for images you might only want to look at digitally. You can also capture video at 320 x 240 and 160 x 120 pixels.  <p>   The camera is very small indeed--smaller than earlier PowerShot models, and is easily pocket sized. There is what at first might seem a bewildering array of buttons around the casing, but in fact these provide excellent one-button-press access to most of the most used features, such as the 3x optical zoom which goes up to 11x when combined with digital zoom features, the macro mode, settings for the flash and self timer. For more advanced features like changing the shutter speed, which it is great to be able to do on a digital camera; you do need to delve into the LED a little further, though.  <p>   Images are stored on CompactFlash card--the largest image can be a couple of MB in size so you'll need to think big when it comes to CF card size with this camera. The battery is removable, and a spare to carry in the pocket might be a good idea.  <p>   Canon supplies a range of desktop software for viewing, editing and making use of your digital images. As with previous PowerShot cameras, one of the tools works with the Stitch Assist mode on the camera itself in the production of panorama shots. Digital cameras get more advanced all the time, but we dare to say that the PowerShot S400 is probably the best pocket sized digital camera we've seen. <I>--Sandra Vogel, Amazon.co.uk</I></EditorialReview>
